# [IMD3901] Canoe Journey - The Fantastic 4

This is a virtual reality experience of time traveling through a canoe journey! Exploring different time periods such as pre-contact, post-contact, and present, the player collects artifacts and learns their names in English and Mohawk. Once all artifacts have been collected, they will be able to join the thanksgiving ceremony where they reflect on their learnings and time spent in the environments.
